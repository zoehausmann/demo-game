Hello! This game is a personal project in an effort to keep my coding skills
sharp and practice thinking about the way programs are structured/organized.

Currently it's a version of the board game Mastermind, but I hope to add stats
and features that will allow users to pit two characters against each other by
having an attacking player choose a set pattern of moves, and a defending player
try to guess/counter the moves. The defender wins by correctly guessing the
attacker's move combination, and the attacker wins if the defender runs out of
turns or reaches 0 HP.

This is very much a work in progress, and just for fun more than anything.
Thanks for stopping by and checking out my code!
